    "## Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "When this project was initially conceived, I expected to explore sale prices for used agriculture equipment, specifically used John Deere row crop tractors. As a data analyst for R. D Offutt Company, I've heard from salespersons of anecdotal reports of how scarce John Deere equipment has become. Scarcity, regardless of real or perceived, appears to have intensified competitive bidding for quality used equipment. Generally, John Deere, like several other equipment manufacturers have struggled to produce equipment at the same rate since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as they were able to prior. John Deere equipment dealerships like [RDO Equipment Company](www.rdoequipment.com), they have limited inventories of new equipment and a persistent customer demand for new equipment. Consequently, the RDO Equipment salespersons have been able to ask and receive a premium margin on new equipment as well as sell used equipment at prices generally deemed higher than typical pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after starting the project, I hoped to find cues that might be useful in determining when the pricing trend might change. In my discussion with RDO Equipment sales leadership, their greatest concern is accumulating too much used inventory, purchased at higher prices, when the market begins to turn. An analyst’s success in providing meaningful insight to the sales teams requires the analyst understanding which market signals are available and which of those signals might be leading or trailing indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Midway through this project, I felt that I might make use of predicted asking prices on John Deere’s Machine Finder Pro website. Before this class, I had used the Machine Finder Pro data to build a multiple regression model to predict the asking prices for row crop tractors. Exploration of the prediction data leads to more questions than the prediction model can answer. There’s too much variation in the sales price by model year and too many inconsistencies in the quantities by model, model year, and asking prices. In short, I currently think relying on the asking price predictive model as the “canary in the coal mine” is an inadequate substitute for other leading indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "While exploring stock prices, commodity prices, steel prices, and labor force statistics, I’ve decided to omit the retail asking price data. Rather, I favor looking at factors contributing to agricultural equipment manufacturers’ increased input costs. I currently think monitoring those contributing factors and watching for a change in direction would be better leading indicator guiding RDO Equipment sales team’s decisions on used equipment holdings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper will explore:\n",
    "- Stock price of leading agricultural manufacturers and steel manufacturers\n",
    "- Producer Price Index for agricultural equipment, crop commodities, and steel manufactures\n",
    "- Employment numbers durable equipment manufacturing\n",
    "- Inflation breakeven rates\n",
    "- Federal Reserve assets\n",

    "### Economist F. A. Hayek's Writings\n",
    "Professor Caton introduced me to Friedrich Hayek's writings and suggested I explore his writings on equilibrium the production of consumers' and producers' goods. Again, in full disclosure, I'm not well-versed in economics and spent time steeping myself in the gait and rythym of his words. I pulled together a synopsis of his second lecture, but admittedly, my synopis feels a bit hollow; I'm uncomfortable with analysis of his words and equally uncomfortable that I have a real conclusion about his positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Hayek's second lecture (LVMI, 2008) he refers to land (e.g. real property) and labor as **original means of production** and **factors of production** refers to concepts of wages, rent, interest. To the receipients (\"owners\") of these factors of production, this is income which can be used to purchase consumer goods. In Hayek's lectures, he proposes three primary arguments responsible for variation in industrial output.\n",
    "- Individuals' willingess to increase or expand their effort.\n",
    "- Changes in the amount of producers' inputs.\n",
    "- Changes in consumption patterns of existing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hayek's arguments suggest that changes in rent, wages and interst are perhaps inversely proportional to  changes in production. Reduction of wages could reflect in more capital available to producers for use in production; contraction in interest rates could also increase capital available to producers. Conversely, increase in wages and interest rates should reduce production capacity. A key distinction in Hayek's lecture is that idled resources are not required for a company to increase production. In the Hayek's third argument in the second lecture, Hayek expresses less concerned about *how* resources are currently used, but emphasises how resources positioned for future use to explain changes to equilibrium in production of producers' and consumers' goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where I think Hayek's words lead me is that the current inflated prices for used ag equipment will be around until such time as John Deere decides to produce more equipment. However, that depends on two factors. First, John Deere's ability to attract and retain the labor force needed to increase production. The second part relates to changes consumer demand where owners and users of the equipment retain used equipment longer or delay purchases additional equipment, new or used. A final, speculative thought on consumer demand suggests that the [right-to-fix movement](https://www.repair.org/agriculture) could have significant impact on ag equipment sales. Generally, speaking, those who own the equipment want tools and access to repair items for themselves. Consider the story of one farmer who appears to have [ran afoul of copyright laws](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/08/17/432601480/diy-tractor-repair-runs-afoul-of-copyright-law ) while hoping to fix his tractor."

    "### Might the limits of steel production capacity be responsible for used ag equipment prices?\n",
    "Might the lack of production from the U.S. steel industry be responsible for increases in the used ag equipment prices? Again, I’m not a great economist mind, but my data explorations reveal a few things. First, agriculture equipment manufacturer’s stock prices follow a similar pattern over the last five years; stock prices have increased post COVID-19; no big news there. Input costs for ag equipment manufacturers have increased sharply over the past 18 months. Besides labor expenses, I assume raw material input costs, like steel and aluminum, are among the top handful of cost drivers. In mid-2018, producer price indexes related to production of ag equipment increase quickly; presumably those specific increase are related to steel and aluminum tariffs. Third, the Producer Price Index for steel manufacturers has seen sharp increases in the past several months, too. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve has increased their assets on their balance sheet; this may not be relevant to cost drivers, but some observations of casual reporting indicate that Fed asset purchases may have unintended effects of propping up commodity prices. Finally, and perhaps the biggest discovery is that the Industrial Production index related to the production of steel goods, while increasing over the last 18 months, remains on whole, flat. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since most of the current economic challenges inflect at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the curious component is steel production volumes. Conventional logic says at the outset of the pandemic, orders for steel should have slowed and production should have slowed, too. The steep drop in production numbers is reflected in the Fed’s Industrial Production indexes for steel and while economy appears to be accelerating, presumably orders for steel have increased, too. However, given current production capacity, steel manufacturers likely can’t produce volume to offset production effort lost to the pandemic related shutdowns.\n"

    "## Commodity Prices for Common Row Crops\n",
    "In reviewing crop acre data from United States Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA) (2021), more than one-third of all ag production acres were planted as corn, wheat, or soybeans. While I assume that commodity prices should have little to no influence on equipment manufacturing input prices, I've often hear anecdotal stories suggesting commodity prices are barometers to equipment demand. The assumption is producers, flush with the proceeds from higher commodity prices, will replace or add to their equipment fleet. Unfortunately, I've not yet found a reliable source for units of equipment sold, by month. I would like to apply some rigor to evaluating the old maxim -- high commodity prices drive demand for equipment -- but until I find the data, I'll have to refer to the maxim to guide my intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following visualizations show the distribution of month-to-month percent of change. While the visualization has the top three crops, by planted acres in 2021, there are numerous other crops with their respective Producers Price Index. to say that potato producers (i.e., farmers) have the most volative input prices would be stretch as we've not looked at other crop types. However, by comparison, it might be interesting to Offutt Farms to see volatility in monthly input prices is generally worse when compared to corn, wheat, and soybeans. I can only speculate to the underlying causes."

Give the Fed's Industrial Production indicies related to steel and steel durable goods, I'd suggest production quantity has little to do with the stock price.

The overall trend is such that more manufacturing jobs seem to be available, yet the number of workers to fill those jobs continues to decline. Again, a very curious thing, but if one looks at the labor participation rates, one will find that this is not a new phenomena.
